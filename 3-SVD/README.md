# SVD. Image compression methods
## Conditions and goals
For this assignment, 3 different image compression algorithms were implemented in Python. The main goal is to evaluate their effectiveness and compare them. It is also possible to save the intermediate state to a file.
## File format
the file stores metadata (H, width and height of the source image) and the matrices themselves U, sigma, V. Saving matrices is described in *saver.py*
## Experiments
### numpy svd
